# FS-builder
A financial statement builder that is made using python (will not have any activity since i have prelims right now)   
A script written in python that build statements of financial performance and positions
    
    
`!a`: appends list of items, will ask for relative values   
`!r`: removes item from list, will ask which item by index    
`!g`: generate the financial statement    
`!s`: show current balances and how the financial statement looks like.   
`!b`: Check if there is a balance or not    

# Why?

Why did I make this? I don't know man, I think I made this for fun. I am not sure if i will use python for this since i might trying doing the same with js. Whatever, man. I think this is also a good revision for both code and account.

# I might not make this project
Why? because it is impractical and very complex.
What do i mean complex? multiple manipulation with strings make this project so difficult to make most people rather do the thing by hand.

Worse of all, spacing and cells. The character size and fonts literally breaks most of the prototypes despite the backend working very well.



I am almost done with financial performance trading business
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i don't know why am i doing this.
