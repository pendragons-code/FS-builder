# FS-builder
A financial statement builder that is made using python (will not have any activity since i have prelims right now)   
A script written in python that build statements of financial performance and positions
    
    
`!a`: appends list of items, will ask for relative values   
`!r`: removes item from list, will ask which item by index    
`!g`: generate the financial statement    
`!s`: show current balances and how the financial statement looks like.   
`!b`: Check if there is a balance or not    

# Why?

Why did I make this? I don't know man, I think I made this for fun. I am not sure if i will use python for this since i might trying doing the same with js. Whatever, man. I think this is also a good revision for both code and account.
